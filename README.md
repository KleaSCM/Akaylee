## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Linux/macOS (Windows support coming soon)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kleascm/akaylee-fuzzer.git
cd akaylee-fuzzer
go mod download
go build -o akaylee-fuzzer ./cmd/fuzzer
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Fuzz a target binary
./akaylee-fuzzer fuzz --target ./my-app --corpus ./seeds

# Fuzz with custom configuration
./akaylee-fuzzer fuzz \
  --target ./my-app \
  --corpus ./seeds \
  --workers 8 \
  --timeout 30s \
  --max-crashes 100
```

## Configuration

Akaylee Fuzzer supports extensive configuration through command-line flags, environment variables, and configuration files.

### Key Configuration Options
- `--workers`: Number of parallel fuzzing workers
- `--timeout`: Maximum execution time per test case
- `--max-crashes`: Maximum number of crashes to collect
- `--corpus-dir`: Directory containing seed corpus
- `--output-dir`: Directory for fuzzer output and artifacts

## Fuzzing Strategies

### 1. Mutation-Based Fuzzing
- **Bit Flipping**: Random bit-level mutations
- **Byte Substitution**: Intelligent byte replacement
- **Structure-Aware**: Maintains data structure integrity

### 2. Generation-Based Fuzzing
- **Grammar-Based**: Uses formal grammars for structured input
- **Template-Based**: Generates inputs from predefined templates
- **Constraint-Based**: Satisfies input constraints and invariants

### 3. Coverage-Guided Fuzzing
- **Edge Coverage**: Tracks basic block transitions
- **Path Coverage**: Monitors execution paths
- **Function Coverage**: Tracks function entry/exit points

## Performance Tuning

### Memory Optimization
- Configure worker pool size based on available RAM
- Use appropriate timeout values to prevent memory leaks
- Enable garbage collection tuning for long-running sessions

### CPU Optimization
- Match worker count to available CPU cores
- Use efficient coverage tracking algorithms
- Optimize mutation strategies for target characteristics
