# Akaylee Fuzzer 

## Overview

Akaylee Fuzzer is a fuzzing engine that combines multiple advanced fuzzing strategies with intelligent execution management. Built with performance and scalability in mind, it's designed to discover vulnerabilities and edge cases in target applications with exceptional efficiency.

## Features

###  Core Capabilities
- **Multi-Strategy Fuzzing**: Combines mutation-based, generation-based, and coverage-guided fuzzing
- **Intelligent Execution Engine**: Advanced process management with crash detection and recovery
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live coverage tracking and performance metrics
- **Corpus Management**: Smart seed corpus evolution and optimization
- **Parallel Execution**: Multi-threaded fuzzing with configurable worker pools

###  Performance Features
- **Zero-Copy Mutations**: Minimizes memory allocations for maximum throughput
- **Efficient Coverage Tracking**: Bitmap-based coverage with minimal overhead
- **Smart Scheduling**: Prioritizes promising test cases based on coverage and crash potential
- **Memory Management**: Optimized memory usage with garbage collection tuning

###  Advanced Capabilities
- **Custom Mutators**: Extensible mutation strategies for domain-specific fuzzing
- **Crash Analysis**: Automated crash triaging and deduplication
- **Reproduction**: Deterministic crash reproduction for debugging
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive reports with vulnerability classification

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Linux/macOS (Windows support coming soon)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kleascm/akaylee-fuzzer.git
cd akaylee-fuzzer
go mod download
go build -o akaylee-fuzzer ./cmd/fuzzer
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Fuzz a target binary
./akaylee-fuzzer fuzz --target ./my-app --corpus ./seeds

# Fuzz with custom configuration
./akaylee-fuzzer fuzz \
  --target ./my-app \
  --corpus ./seeds \
  --workers 8 \
  --timeout 30s \
  --max-crashes 100
```

## Configuration

Akaylee Fuzzer supports extensive configuration through command-line flags, environment variables, and configuration files.

### Key Configuration Options
- `--workers`: Number of parallel fuzzing workers
- `--timeout`: Maximum execution time per test case
- `--max-crashes`: Maximum number of crashes to collect
- `--corpus-dir`: Directory containing seed corpus
- `--output-dir`: Directory for fuzzer output and artifacts

## Fuzzing Strategies

### 1. Mutation-Based Fuzzing
- **Bit Flipping**: Random bit-level mutations
- **Byte Substitution**: Intelligent byte replacement
- **Structure-Aware**: Maintains data structure integrity

### 2. Generation-Based Fuzzing
- **Grammar-Based**: Uses formal grammars for structured input
- **Template-Based**: Generates inputs from predefined templates
- **Constraint-Based**: Satisfies input constraints and invariants

### 3. Coverage-Guided Fuzzing
- **Edge Coverage**: Tracks basic block transitions
- **Path Coverage**: Monitors execution paths
- **Function Coverage**: Tracks function entry/exit points

## Performance Tuning

### Memory Optimization
- Configure worker pool size based on available RAM
- Use appropriate timeout values to prevent memory leaks
- Enable garbage collection tuning for long-running sessions

### CPU Optimization
- Match worker count to available CPU cores
- Use efficient coverage tracking algorithms
- Optimize mutation strategies for target characteristics
