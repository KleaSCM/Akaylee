Akaylee Fuzzer TODO

## âœ… COMPLETED FEATURES

### Core Engine & Infrastructure
[x] Modular engine with concurrency and priority queue
[x] Multiple mutation strategies (bit flip, byte substitution, arithmetic, structure-aware, crossover)
[x] Process execution with resource limits
[x] Basic crash and hang detection
[x] Logging (structured, timestamped, beautiful)
[x] Metrics output (per-test, per-suite, timestamped, versioned)
[x] Corpus management and prioritization
[x] CLI with config management
[x] Real code coverage integration (e.g., go-fuzz, libFuzzer, custom)
[x] Scheduler abstraction and pluggable strategies
[x] Composite mutator chains
[x] Reporter/telemetry hooks (logging, Prometheus stub)
[x] Enterprise logging (syslog/journald, async queue)
[x] Crash matching (regex/ruleset)
[x] API polish (Go doc comments, coverage abstraction)
[x] Executor/Analyzer Reset, Mutator Init
[x] TestCase enhancements (generation tracking)
[x] Adapter refactor and execution result mapping
[x] Thread safety & performance improvements
[x] Resource monitoring fixes (goroutine leak, avgCPU helper)

### CLI & Configuration
[x] --dry-run Mode (configuration validation without fuzzing)
[x] --list-mutators Option (display all available mutators)
[x] Persistent Session UUID (correlation across systems)
[x] Built-in Self-Check (system validation for CI/CD)
[x] Automatic Corpus Shrinking (keep only most interesting cases)

### Advanced Fuzzing Capabilities
[x] Advanced input structure inference (grammar-based, protocol-aware)
[x] Crash triage and minimization
[x] Reproducibility harness (auto-replay of crashes)
[x] Differential fuzzing (compare multiple implementations)
[x] State-aware fuzzing (for stateful targets (databases, APIs))
[x] HTML dashboards - Beautiful web reports
[x] API fuzzing - Network and HTTP target support
